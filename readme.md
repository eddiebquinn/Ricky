# Ricky
A bot based on [RICO-bot](https://github.com/eddiebquinn/RICO-bot) to address the shortcomings of its predecessor. The main feature added is the ability to run on multiple servers. This was done to decentralise the NoFap community and move away from centralised hub servers. While this bot inherits many of the original streak related features of its predecessor, it also strips away many features. The reason for this is because a lot of what the previous iteration was doing, could be done by many other bots in far better ways.
